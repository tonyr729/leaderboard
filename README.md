# Leaderboard

If you're a fan of a sport that doesn't get a lot of television coverage, or one that happens during the week while you're at work, then you're probably used to looking at a leader board and constantly refreshing the page to see what has happened. Leaderboard makes this interaction more enjoyable with dynamic re-ordering of the list and viewing of media on an update. Updates happen automatically, thanks to the implementation of socket.io.
